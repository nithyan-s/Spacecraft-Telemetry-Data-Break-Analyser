# Spacecraft-Telemetry-Data-Break-Analyser
Project Overview<br>
This project focuses on analyzing spacecraft telemetry data to identify data breaks and generate a comprehensive report on the durations of these breaks. Telemetry data is essential for monitoring the health and performance of spacecraft, and ensuring continuous data flow is crucial for mission success. Breaks in telemetry data can indicate communication interruptions, equipment failures, or data acquisition issues, all of which require investigation and mitigation.

The purpose of this project is to detect such breaks in the telemetry data, quantify their duration, and produce a detailed report that can be used for further analysis and operational planning.

Applications<br>
This tool has practical applications in space mission operations, particularly for spacecraft monitoring systems. It provides mission control teams with insights into data loss events, helping them take appropriate measures to maintain the integrity of telemetry data. By automating the detection of data breaks, this tool reduces the manual effort required to process large telemetry datasets and offers a scalable solution for managing data streams from multiple spacecraft.
